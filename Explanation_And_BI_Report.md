# UK_Environment_Analysis

The present Power BI report is a simple visualization to try to see the relation between the average temperatures and rainfall volume in the UK and the primery and renewable energy sources usages between the years od 2010 and 2019.

On Kaggle, there were two separate datasets, one that brought the average temperatures and rainfall volume in the UK between 2010 and 2019 and another that brought the renewable energy sources usages during the same period. With this, I saw the oportunity to try to find a relation between these parameters that are so connected in nature, mainly because the gases associated with the combustion of primary fuels are harmfull to the atmosphere and can bring strong imbalances on climate, increasing the average temperature and atmosphere evets such as rain.

The average temperature and rainfall volume in the UK were plotted in a time series, as well as the usage of Renewable and waste energy sources and usage of primary fuels.
At first, we can se that along the years, the usage of renewable and waste sources of energy sources incresed, and the usage of primary fuels decreased. Even though primary fuels are still used way more than renewable and waste sources, we can see that in 2014 the variation of the average temperature and rainfall volume decreased, showing that, at first glance, the efforts of switching to renewable and waste sources can indeed have impacts in the way our atmosphere behaves. Certainly if we had not decreased the usage of primary fuels along the years, we would have seen an increase of the curve related to the average temperature, and not its stability. Also, apart of the 2019 datapoint, rainfall had a (close to) uniform decrease between 2014 and 2018, which can be a result of the global warming and a sign to be careful with the primary fuels usage.

Also, regarding the renewable and waste sources, the landfill gas source was an expressive source os renewable energy until 2014, when wood and wind, wave, tidal took over as the top. Municipal solid waste is also as honorable mention, since that between 2015 and 2019 it had its usage increased. This info can be accesed through the tooltip visual in the lower graphic on the report.
